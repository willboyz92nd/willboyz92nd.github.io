While things were much calmer, this was not always so true. Many monsters from beyond our world have threatened our home, and yet every time a hero has challenged the forces that drive this land into ruin. These heros are known as Hōrō-sha, and their job is to obtain forbidden knowledge and slay the monsters attacking our world.",
